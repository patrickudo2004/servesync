# Product Description – ServeSync

**App Name:** ServeSync  
**Tagline:** Real-time volunteer management for churches — the Five Guys app, built for the house of God.  
**Version:** 1.0 MVP (March 2026)  
**Target Audience:** Churches of all sizes (starting with Winners Chapel Manchester and expanding to any church worldwide)  
**Core Purpose:** ServeSync is a modern, mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) that completely replaces chaotic Google Sheets, WhatsApp groups, paper sign-in sheets, and manual rotas with a single, secure, real-time platform designed exactly around how churches actually operate.

## Vision & Mission

Churches run on volunteers — but managing them is still stuck in 2000s tools.  
ServeSync brings church volunteer management into the 2020s with the same simplicity and authority structure pastors already use.

It turns every Sunday into a smooth, joyful experience: volunteers scan a QR code and instantly appear as “present” on every leader’s phone. Leaders spend minutes instead of hours on rotas. Pastoral Oversight gets spiritual insight and escalation tools. Volunteers feel seen, valued, and motivated through recognition badges and easy self-service.

ServeSync is not just another rota app — it is the **digital nervous system** for church volunteer teams.

## Key Differentiators (What Makes ServeSync Unique)

1. **Real Hierarchy That Matches Real Churches**  
   Super Admin → Deacon Head (Governing Board) → Pastoral Oversight → Department Head → Subunit Lead → Volunteer

2. **Deacon Head Role (Governing Board)**  
   A navy-blue badge role representing the church’s governing deacon board. One Deacon Head is assigned per department. They approve major escalations, have church-wide visibility, and communicate via a private Deacon Board channel — completely separate from system admin access.

3. **Pastoral Oversight Role**  
   A dedicated green-badge role above Department Heads with read-only visibility, escalation authority to the Deacon Board, and special “Oversight Messages” in chat.

3. **Killer Attendance Feature**  
   Dynamic QR codes displayed on the projector or at the door. Volunteers scan with their phone. The app checks geofence (inside the church) and service time window. Updates appear live for every leader and Pastoral Oversight.

4. **Volunteer Love Built In**  
   Automatic streak badges, perfect attendance awards, Hall of Fame, confetti celebrations, and a personal profile that shows “You’ve served 187 hours this year.”

5. **Smart Flexibility**  
   Shift Swap Marketplace + inter-department borrowing so no more last-minute WhatsApp begging.

6. **Everything in One App**  
   Rotas, attendance, time-off approvals, probation KPI tracking, chat with file uploads, recognition, organogram — no more switching between 5 different tools.
