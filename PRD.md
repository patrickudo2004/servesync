# Product Requirements Document (PRD) – ServeSync v1.0 MVP

**Product Name:** ServeSync  
**Version:** 1.0 MVP  
**Date:** March 2026  
**Product Owner:** [Your Name]  
**Target Users:** Churches (starting with Winners Chapel Manchester, then any church worldwide)  
**Platform:** Google Antigravity + Convex backend + Vercel frontend  
**Goal:** Build a production-ready, multi-tenant, real-time volunteer management SaaS that completely replaces Google Sheets, WhatsApp groups, and paper sign-in sheets for church departments.

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Vision

ServeSync is a modern, mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) built specifically for churches. It provides a single, secure, real-time platform for managing volunteers across departments and subunits with the **exact hierarchy churches already use**.

### Key Differentiators
- Real-time QR-code attendance with geofence verification (the “killer feature”)
- Pastoral Oversight role with spiritual covering and escalation authority
- Volunteer recognition, streaks, and Hall of Fame to drive retention
- Shift-swap marketplace and inter-department borrowing to eliminate last-minute chaos
- Scoped real-time chat with file uploads (no more WhatsApp)
- Strict role-based permissions and row-level security

**Success Vision:** On any Sunday, a volunteer scans a QR → every leader and Pastoral Oversight sees the update instantly → rotas, probation, and morale are managed in one beautiful app.

---

## 2. Business Objectives

- Reduce volunteer management admin time for leaders by **80%**
- Increase volunteer retention through recognition and easy self-service
- Give Pastoral Oversight and Senior Pastors real data and escalation tools
- Make the app feel like a native mobile app (installable PWA)
- Enable any church to sign up and run their own isolated tenant in under 2 minutes

**Instructions to Antigravity Agent:**

Use high-reasoning mode. Follow the detailed master prompt style from our previous conversation. Generate files in logical batches and ask for confirmation before major schema changes. Prioritise mobile-first and real-time behaviour. Make every component production-ready with perfect TypeScript, error handling, loading states, and optimistic updates.
