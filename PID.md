# Project Initiation Document – ServeSync v1.0 MVP
**Date:** March 2026  
**Project Owner:** [Your Name]  
**Platform:** Google Antigravity + Convex + Vercel  
**Target Launch:** Winners Chapel Manchester (then multi-church SaaS)

## 1. Project Vision & Objectives
Create a modern, real-time volunteer management platform that mirrors exactly how large churches operate. It must feel like a native mobile app (PWA) and completely replace Google Sheets rotas, WhatsApp groups, and paper sign-in sheets. Key goal: reduce admin time for leaders by 80% while making volunteers feel valued and seen.

## 2. Exact Hierarchy & Roles (non-negotiable)
| Role                  | Colour          | Icon                  | Authority Level                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Super Admin           | Purple #8b5cf6  | Crown                 | Church-wide full control         |
| Pastoral Oversight    | Deep Green #15803d | Shepherd staff / cross | Spiritual covering + escalation |
| Department Head       | Black #111827   | Gold border           | Day-to-day department management |
| Subunit Lead          | Slate Gray #6b7280 | —                   | Subunit operations & attendance  |
| Volunteer             | Red #ef4444     | —                     | Base user                        |
| Probation             | Blue #3b82f6    | Dashed border         | Monitored period                 |
| On Notice             | Orange #f59e0b  | —                     | Warning status                   |
| Borrowed              | Purple outline  | —                     | Temporary cross-dept assignment  |

## 3. Exhaustive Feature Specification
**Core Loops**
- Church creation → hierarchical invites → role assignment
- Real-time QR attendance with geofence
- Rota creation + Shift Swap Marketplace
- Probation KPI logging + auto reports
- Inter-department borrowing workflow
- Scoped real-time chat with file uploads (Convex storage)
- Volunteer Recognition system (auto streaks + manual badges + Hall of Fame)
- Pastoral Oversight escalation & special green chat messages

**Mobile Experience (mandatory)**
- Fixed bottom navigation (role-aware)
- Role-specific home screens
- Full PWA (installable, offline-first where possible)

**Security & Permissions**
- Row-level security in every Convex function
- Higher roles can only escalate/override, never do lower-level daily tasks unless escalated

**UI/UX Principles**
- Mobile-first (375px base)
- Dark mode default
- Church-friendly (clean, encouraging, large touch targets)
- Real-time updates on every screen

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- Stack: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Convex + Vanilla CSS + Lucide
- Real-time everywhere
- No third-party storage at MVP (use Convex files)
- Deployable to Vercel
- Invite-only, Google + Magic Link auth

## 5. Success Criteria (measurable)
- Volunteer scans QR during service → all leaders and Oversight see update in <2 seconds
- Pastoral Oversight can escalate any issue with one tap
- Volunteers receive badges and see Hall of Fame
- Shift swaps happen without WhatsApp
- App works perfectly offline for attendance marking (syncs later)

## 6. Phase Plan for Antigravity Agent
Phase 1: Schema + Auth + Pastoral Oversight role  
Phase 2: Dashboards + Mobile Layout + Bottom Nav  
Phase 3: Attendance QR + Rota + Shift Swap  
Phase 4: Probation KPI + Borrowing + Chat + Recognition  
Phase 5: Polish, PWA, Organogram, Notifications, Testing
